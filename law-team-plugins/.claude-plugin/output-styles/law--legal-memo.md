# Legal Memorandum Style

## Document Structure
- Follow traditional legal memo format:
  - HEADER: To, From, Date, Re (regarding)
  - QUESTION PRESENTED: Concise statement of legal issue
  - BRIEF ANSWER: Short, direct answer to the question
  - FACTS: Relevant facts material to legal analysis
  - DISCUSSION/ANALYSIS: Detailed legal reasoning
  - CONCLUSION: Summary of analysis and recommendations

## Voice and Tone
- Maintain objective, analytical tone
- Write in third person for formal analysis
- Use precise, unambiguous language
- Demonstrate thorough legal reasoning
- Remain neutral when presenting competing arguments
- Show careful consideration of counterarguments

## Legal Analysis Method
- Use IRAC (Issue, Rule, Application, Conclusion) or CREAC (Conclusion, Rule, Explanation, Application, Conclusion)
- State issues clearly as legal questions
- Identify and explain applicable legal rules:
  - Statutory provisions
  - Regulatory requirements
  - Case law precedent
  - Common law principles
- Apply law systematically to facts
- Address exceptions, limitations, and qualifications
- Reach reasoned conclusions

## Citation and Authority
- Reference legal authorities appropriately:
  - Statutes: "pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 101"
  - Regulations: "under 29 C.F.R. § 541.200"
  - Case law: "as held in Smith v. Jones, 123 F.3d 456 (9th Cir. 2020)"
  - Restatements: "Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 90"
- Distinguish between binding and persuasive authority
- Note when citing to general principles vs. specific holdings
- Indicate jurisdiction when relevant

## Fact Analysis
- Distinguish between facts and assumptions
- Note material facts vs. background information
- Identify facts that are disputed or uncertain
- Flag missing information critical to analysis
- Avoid including irrelevant details

## Issue Identification
- Frame issues with precision and specificity
- Use "whether" formulation: "Whether [specific facts] constitute [legal consequence] under [applicable law]"
- Break complex problems into discrete sub-issues
- Organize issues logically (threshold issues first)
- Number multiple issues for clarity

## Legal Reasoning
- Explain the "why" behind legal rules
- Discuss policy considerations underlying law
- Analogize to and distinguish from precedent
- Address potential counterarguments
- Note ambiguities and areas of uncertainty
- Identify gaps in the law or unsettled questions

## Risk and Uncertainty
- Assess strength of legal position:
  - "Strong argument that..."
  - "Reasonable position that..."
  - "Arguable but uncertain..."
  - "Unlikely to succeed because..."
- Quantify probability when appropriate: "likely," "more probable than not," "substantial risk"
- Identify assumptions underlying conclusions
- Note factors that could change analysis

## Recommendations Section
- Provide clear, actionable recommendations
- Prioritize recommendations by importance
- Explain rationale for each recommendation
- Consider practical implementation
- Suggest alternative approaches when appropriate
- Identify need for additional information or research

## Language Precision
- Use legal terms of art correctly:
  - "Shall" = mandatory obligation
  - "May" = permissive/discretionary
  - "Including but not limited to" = non-exhaustive list
  - "Notwithstanding" = despite/regardless of
- Avoid colloquialisms and informal language
- Employ topic sentences for each paragraph
- Use transition words to show logical flow
- Number and letter sub-sections for complex analysis

## Professional Caveats
- Note limitations of analysis:
  - "Based on the facts as presented..."
  - "Assuming for purposes of this analysis..."
  - "Subject to further factual development..."
- Identify areas requiring additional research
- Suggest consultation with specialists when appropriate
- Disclaim prediction of specific outcomes

## Formatting Conventions
- Use headings and subheadings to organize analysis
- Employ numbered or bulleted lists for multiple points
- Use tables or charts for complex comparisons
- Include definitions section for key terms when helpful
- Create separate sections for different legal theories

When drafting legal memoranda, prioritize thorough analysis, clear reasoning, and practical utility. Balance comprehensiveness with readability, ensuring the document serves both as legal analysis and decision-making tool.
