# Legal Team Approaches, Tones, and Styles

Legal teams generally adopt distinct approaches, tones, and styles depending on the specific situation, organizational culture, and goals. This document outlines the four primary approaches available in the law-team plugin.

## Overview of Four Approaches

### 1. The Adversarial Approach

**Core Philosophy:** Winning at all costs, treating the other side as an opponent to be defeated.

**When to Use:**
- High-stakes litigation
- Contentious negotiations
- Protecting against aggressive opposing counsel
- Situations where relationship preservation is not a priority
- When facing bad-faith actors
- Disputes where compromise would harm client interests

**Example Language:**

- **Adversarial:** (Maybe) Protecting against particularly aggressive investor terms

**Example 2: Employment Termination**

- **Collaborative:** (If possible) Reaching mutually agreeable severance
- **Adversarial:** (If necessary) Protecting against wrongful termination claims
- **Business-Partner:** Considering business implications of different approaches

**Example 3: Vendor Contract Negotiation**

## Approach Selection Context

When you engage with the law-team plugin, you should be asked to select your preferred approach at the start of the session. This ensures:

1. **Consistent tone and style** throughout the interaction
2. **Aligned recommendations** with your situation and goals
3. **Appropriate risk calibration** for your needs
4. **Suitable communication style** for your context

### The Selection Process

You'll be presented with these four options and asked to select the one that best fits your current needs:

1. **Adversarial** - "We're in a fight, help me win"
2. **Collaborative** - "Let's find a solution that works for everyone"
3. **Preventative** - "Help me avoid problems before they happen"
4. **Business-Partner** - "Help me get this business deal done"

Your selection will guide:
- **Communication tone** in all outputs
- **Risk tolerance** in recommendations
- **Strategy recommendations**
- **Negotiation tactics** (if applicable)
- **Level of formality** in documents and communications

## Approach-Specific Disclaimers

### All Approaches Share:
- **Not legal advice** - Information is educational only
- **No attorney-client relationship** created
- **Consult licensed attorney** for your specific situation
- **Laws vary by jurisdiction** and change frequently

### Additional Disclaimers by Approach:

**Adversarial:**
> This adversarial approach may escalate conflicts and damage relationships. Consider whether this approach aligns with your long-term interests. Aggressive legal tactics should be used thoughtfully and with full understanding of consequences.

**Collaborative:**
> Collaborative approaches require good-faith participation from all parties. If the other party is acting in bad faith, this approach may not be effective and you may need to switch to a more adversarial stance.

**Preventative:**
> While preventative measures reduce risk, they cannot eliminate all legal exposure. Some level of risk is inherent in all business activities. Over-compliance can also create unnecessary costs and operational burdens.

**Business-Partner:**
> Business-partner approach accepts calibrated risk to enable business objectives. This is not appropriate for all situations, especially in highly regulated industries or where legal compliance is non-negotiable. Business goals never justify illegal activity.

## Changing Approaches Mid-Session

You can change approaches at any time by explicitly requesting:
- "Switch to adversarial approach"
- "Let's take a more collaborative approach"
- "Focus on compliance and risk prevention"
- "Help me think about this as a business partner"

This flexibility allows you to adapt as situations evolve.

## Best Practices

1. **Start with the right approach** - Take time to select thoughtfully
2. **Consider the full context** - Think about relationships, stakes, timeline
3. **Be willing to adapt** - Situations change, approaches should too
4. **Communicate your needs** - Tell Claude what you're trying to achieve
5. **Ask questions** - If unsure which approach, ask for guidance based on your situation
