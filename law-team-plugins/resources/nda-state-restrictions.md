# NDA State-by-State Restrictions and Federal Requirements

A comprehensive guide to Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) enforceability, restrictions, and legal requirements across all 50 states and federal law.

## Federal Laws Affecting NDAs

### Defend Trade Secrets Act (DTSA, 18 U.S.C. § 1836)

**Purpose:** Provides federal protection for trade secrets in NDAs

**Key Provisions:**
- Allows federal lawsuits for trade secret misappropriation
- Creates uniform federal standard (previously only state law)
- Covers trade secrets related to products/services in interstate/foreign commerce
- Available remedies: Injunctions, damages, attorney's fees

**Required Notice for Employment NDAs:**

All employment contracts, NDAs, and non-compete agreements must include whistleblower immunity notice:

```
NOTICE OF IMMUNITY UNDER THE DEFEND TRADE SECRETS ACT:

An individual may not be held criminally or civilly liable under any federal
or state trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret that:

(A) is made (i) in confidence to a federal, state, or local government
official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney; and (ii) solely
for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or

(B) is made in a complaint or other document that is filed under seal in a
lawsuit or other proceeding.

An individual who files a lawsuit for retaliation by an employer for reporting
a suspected violation of law may disclose the employer's trade secrets to the
attorney and use the trade secret information in the court proceeding if the
individual:
(A) files any document containing the trade secret under seal; and
(B) does not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order.
```

**Failure to Include Notice:**
- Cannot recover exemplary damages or attorney's fees in action against employee
- Does not invalidate entire NDA, but limits remedies

### Speak Out Act (2022)

**Purpose:** Prohibits pre-dispute NDAs/non-disparagement clauses for sexual assault/harassment

**Key Provisions:**
- Applies to disputes arising after December 7, 2022
- Voids pre-dispute NDAs that prevent discussion of sexual assault or sexual harassment
- Applies to employment, contractor, and settlement agreements
- "Pre-dispute" means signed before dispute arose
- Post-dispute NDAs still permitted if victim chooses

**What's Prohibited:**
- Agreements signed before harassment/assault occurred
- Clauses that prevent reporting or discussing sexual misconduct
- Mandatory arbitration clauses for such claims

**What's Still Allowed:**
- Post-dispute settlement agreements (after claim arises)
- NDAs for other confidential information
- Victim-requested confidentiality in settlements

### Whistleblower Protection Laws

**Multiple Federal Statutes Protect Disclosures:**

**41 U.S.C. § 4712 (Government Contractors):**
- Prohibits retaliation against employees who disclose waste, fraud, abuse
- NDAs cannot prevent such disclosures

**Dodd-Frank Act (SEC Whistleblower):**
- Protects disclosures of securities violations to SEC
- NDAs cannot waive whistleblower awards or retaliate

**Sarbanes-Oxley Act:**
- Protects corporate fraud whistleblowers
- NDAs cannot silence financial fraud reports

**Other Protected Disclosures:**
- OSHA violations
- Environmental violations
- Healthcare fraud
- Tax fraud

**Key Principle:** NDAs cannot prevent reporting of illegal activity to government authorities

### Classified Information (Executive Order 13526)

**For Government/Contractor Work:**
- Separate NDAs required (e.g., SF-312 for classified information)
- More stringent requirements than commercial NDAs
- Criminal penalties for violations
- Lifetime confidentiality obligations

## State-by-State NDA Enforceability

**General Rule:** NDAs are enforceable in all states if:
1. Supported by consideration
2. Reasonable in scope and duration
3. Not against public policy
4. Protect legitimate business interest

**Key Differences by State:**
- Definition of "reasonable" varies
- Employment vs. commercial NDAs treated differently
- Restrictions on harassment/discrimination NDAs
- Sunset clause requirements vary

|----------|-----------------------------------|-------|
| **1-2 years** | All states | May be too short for valuable info |

## Common NDA Mistakes to Avoid

### For Drafters

1. **Too Broad Definition**
   - ❌ "All information shared"
   - ✅ "Information marked confidential or identified as such within 30 days"

2. **Missing Exclusions**
   - ❌ No exceptions listed
   - ✅ Standard exclusions for public info, independent development

3. **No Duration**
   - ❌ Silent on term or perpetual without justification
   - ✅ Specific term (e.g., "3 years from disclosure") or perpetual for trade secrets only

4. **Missing Legal Disclosure Exception**
   - ❌ "Cannot disclose for any reason"
   - ✅ "Except as required by law with notice to discloser where possible"

5. **No DTSA Notice (Employment)**
   - ❌ Missing whistleblower immunity notice
   - ✅ Full DTSA notice included

6. **Illegal Restrictions**
   - ❌ Pre-dispute harassment silencing
   - ✅ Complies with Speak Out Act and state law

7. **One-Sided Remedies**
   - ❌ Only discloser can recover fees
   - ✅ Mutual or appropriate to relationship

### For Signers

1. **Not Reading Carefully**
   - Always read entire NDA
   - Understand what you're agreeing to
   - Ask questions before signing

2. **Signing Under Pressure**
   - Take time to review
   - Consult attorney if significant
   - Negotiate if terms unfavorable

3. **Not Keeping Copy**
   - Always keep signed copy
   - Review before disclosing information
   - Track expiration dates

4. **Not Marking Information**
   - If marking required, mark clearly
   - Within required time period
   - Consistent with definition

5. **Over-Disclosing**
   - Only disclose what's necessary
   - Consider what you're marking confidential
   - Document what you disclose

## Special Situations

### Employment NDAs

**Special Considerations:**
- DTSA whistleblower notice required (federal)
- State restrictions on harassment/discrimination (many states)
- Consideration requirement (job offer, continued employment, bonus)
- At-will employment doesn't provide continued consideration in all states
- May need separate confidentiality agreement from offer letter

**Best Practice:**
- Separate NDA from employment agreement or include as section
- Clear that confidentiality survives termination
- Distinguish from non-compete (separate enforceability standards)

### Mutual NDAs

**When Used:**
- Both parties sharing confidential information
- Business partnerships, joint ventures
- Vendor relationships with two-way info flow

**Key Provisions:**
- Mirror confidentiality obligations
- May have different durations for different parties' info
- Clear marking requirements for each party
- Mutual remedies

### Multi-Party NDAs

**Challenges:**
- More parties = more complexity
- Need to specify who can disclose to whom
- May need separate obligations by party

**Best Practice:**
- Consider separate bilateral NDAs instead
- If multi-party, very clear chart of permitted disclosures
- Specify lead party for enforcement

### Unilateral vs. Mutual

**Unilateral (One-Way):**
- One party discloses, other receives
- Common in: employment, customer relationships, vendor evaluation
- Typically stronger for discloser

**Mutual (Two-Way):**
- Both parties disclose and receive
- Common in: partnerships, joint ventures, M&A discussions
- Terms typically balanced

## International Considerations

**If Multi-Jurisdictional:**

1. **Specify Governing Law**
   - Choose one jurisdiction
   - Consider neutrality or party advantage
   - Account for enforceability

2. **International Treaties**
   - GDPR (EU) - special requirements for data
   - Other data protection laws
   - May need separate agreements by region

3. **Enforcement Challenges**
   - Enforcing judgment across borders difficult
   - Consider arbitration for international disputes
   - Local counsel review recommended

## Resources for NDA Drafting/Review

- **AIPLA** (American Intellectual Property Law Association) - model forms
- **WIPO** (World Intellectual Property Organization) - international templates
- **State bar associations** - may provide templates

### When to Hire Attorney

- Complex multi-party arrangements
- International NDAs
- Employment NDAs (for employer - ensure compliance)
- M&A or significant business transactions
- When other party has attorney and you don't
- State-specific compliance questions

**Cost Expectations:**
- Simple NDA review: $300-$800
- Custom NDA drafting: $500-$1,500

### State Bar Resources

## Conclusion

NDAs are powerful tools for protecting confidential information, but they must be:
- Reasonable in scope and duration
- Compliant with federal and state law
- Balanced for the relationship
- Clear and specific

Always:
- Review carefully before signing
- Understand your obligations
