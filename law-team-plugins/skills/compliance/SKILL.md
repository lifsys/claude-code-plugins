# Business Compliance and Regulatory Guidance Skill

This skill provides comprehensive guidance on maintaining compliance with legal and regulatory requirements for business operations.

## CRITICAL: Approach Selection Required

**BEFORE proceeding with any compliance work, you MUST determine the user's preferred legal approach.**

Use the `AskUserQuestion` tool with these four options:

**Question:** "What legal approach best fits your compliance situation?"

**Options:**
1. **Adversarial** - "Help me defend against regulatory action" (Enforcement response, litigation defense)
2. **Collaborative** - "Help me work with regulators cooperatively" (Voluntary disclosure, cooperative remediation)
3. **Preventative/Compliance** - "Help me stay ahead of compliance requirements" (Audit-ready, comprehensive programs)
4. **Business-Partner** - "Help me meet compliance without killing business" (Risk-calibrated, practical compliance)

**After selection:** Adopt the selected approach for ALL compliance recommendations, program design, and risk assessments.

**Reference:** See `/resources/legal-approaches.md` for comprehensive documentation on each approach.

## Employment Law Compliance

### Employee Classification

**Critical Decision: Employee vs. Independent Contractor**

**IRS Test (Economic Reality Test):**

1. **Behavioral Control:**
   - Does company control HOW worker does job?
   - Does company provide training?
   - Does company set work hours?
   - **Employee:** Company controls
   - **Contractor:** Worker controls

2. **Financial Control:**
   - Does worker invest in equipment/tools?
   - Can worker work for others?
   - Does worker have unreimbursed expenses?
   - How is worker paid?
   - **Employee:** Company provides tools, exclusive, salary
   - **Contractor:** Own tools, multiple clients, project-based

3. **Relationship:**
   - Written contract?
   - Benefits provided?
   - Permanency of relationship?
   - Core to business?
   - **Employee:** Benefits, permanent, core
   - **Contractor:** No benefits, project-based, supplemental

**Misclassification Risks:**
- Back taxes (employer portion of FICA)
- Penalties and interest
- Unemployment insurance claims
- Workers' comp claims
- Benefits claims
- Lawsuits for unpaid wages/overtime

**State Tests May Differ:**
- California: ABC test (very strict, presumes employee)
- Massachusetts: ABC test
- Many states adopting stricter tests

**Best Practices:**
- When in doubt, classify as employee
- Don't rely solely on worker preference
- Document reasons for classification
- Review annually
- Consult employment attorney for questionable cases

### Exempt vs. Non-Exempt Employees

**Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) Classification**

**Non-Exempt:**
- Entitled to overtime (1.5x for hours over 40/week)
- Must track hours worked
- Typically hourly employees
- Must receive minimum wage

**Exempt:**
- Not entitled to overtime
- Must meet all three tests:
  1. Salary basis test
  2. Salary level test
  3. Duties test

**Salary Basis Test:**
- Paid predetermined salary not subject to reduction based on quality/quantity of work
- Full salary for any week in which work is performed
- Limited deductions allowed (full-day absences for personal reasons, unpaid leave)

**Salary Level Test (as of 2024):**
- Must earn at least $684/week ($35,568 annually)
- Highly compensated employees: $107,432 annually
- Note: Some states have higher thresholds (CA, NY)

**Duties Test (must meet one):**

**Executive Exemption:**
- Primary duty: Manage enterprise or department
- Regularly supervises 2+ full-time employees
- Authority to hire/fire or recommendations given particular weight

**Administrative Exemption:**

  - Examples: Artists, musicians, writers, actors

- Paid at least $684/week salary OR $27.63/hour

**Outside Sales Exemption:**
- Primary duty: Making sales or obtaining orders/contracts
- Regularly engaged away from employer's place of business
- No salary level requirement

**Common Mistakes:**
- Assuming job title determines exemption (doesn't)
- Classifying "managers" who don't manage (e.g., "Assistant Manager" with no supervisory duties)
- Paying salary and assuming exempt (must meet duties test)
- Misunderstanding "primary duty" (what employee spends most time doing AND most important duty)

**State Law May Be More Restrictive:**
- California: Higher salary threshold, stricter duties tests
- New York: Higher salary threshold (varies by location and employer size)
- Many states have own exemption rules

**Reclassification Risks:**
- Back overtime pay (often 2-3 years, sometimes longer)
