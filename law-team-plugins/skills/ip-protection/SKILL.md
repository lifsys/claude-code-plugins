# Intellectual Property Protection Skill

This skill provides comprehensive guidance on identifying, protecting, and managing intellectual property assets.

## CRITICAL: Approach Selection Required

**BEFORE proceeding with any IP work, you MUST determine the user's preferred legal approach.**

Use the `AskUserQuestion` tool with these four options:

**Question:** "What legal approach best fits your IP protection situation?"

**Options:**
1. **Adversarial** - "Protect my IP aggressively against infringement" (Offensive enforcement, litigation-ready)
2. **Collaborative** - "Find ways to share IP while protecting value" (Licensing, partnerships, strategic alliances)
3. **Preventative/Compliance** - "Help me secure my IP properly from the start" (Registration, documentation, risk prevention)
4. **Business-Partner** - "Help me leverage IP for business growth" (Monetization, competitive advantage, practical protection)

**After selection:** Adopt the selected approach for ALL IP strategy, protection recommendations, and enforcement guidance.

**Reference:** See `/resources/legal-approaches.md` for comprehensive documentation on each approach.

## When to Use This Skill

Activate this skill when the user:
- Asks about protecting a business name, logo, or brand
- Wants to patent an invention or protect a new product
- Needs copyright protection for creative works or software
- Asks about trade secrets or confidential information
- Wants to understand different types of IP
- Needs help with USPTO or Copyright Office processes
- Asks about trademark or patent search
- Needs an IP strategy for their business

## Four Types of Intellectual Property

### 1. Trademarks

**What They Protect:** Brand identifiers - names, logos, slogans, colors, sounds, smells (anything that identifies source of goods/services)

**Duration:** Indefinite, as long as continuously used and renewed

**Registration:** Optional but strongly recommended (federal registration provides significant benefits)

#### What Can Be Trademarked

**Word Marks:**
- Business names: "Apple" for computers
- Product names: "iPhone" for smartphones
- Service names: "QuickBooks" for accounting software
- Slogans: "Just Do It" for athletic wear

**Design Marks:**
- Logos: Nike swoosh
- Stylized text: Coca-Cola script
- Symbols and icons

**Non-Traditional Marks:**
- Colors: Tiffany blue for jewelry boxes
- Sounds: NBC chimes
- Product shapes: Coca-Cola bottle
- Scents: Play-Doh smell

**What CANNOT Be Trademarked:**
- Generic terms: "Computer" for computers
- Merely descriptive terms without secondary meaning: "Fast" for delivery services (unless acquired distinctiveness)
- Government insignia
- Immoral or scandalous matter
- Marks that are confusingly similar to existing marks
- Personal names without consent
- Geographic terms (without secondary meaning)

#### Trademark Strength Spectrum

From strongest to weakest:

1. **Fanciful** - Invented words (KODAK, XEROX)
   - Strongest protection
   - No meaning except as brand

2. **Arbitrary** - Real words with no connection to product (APPLE for computers)
   - Very strong protection
   - Word exists but unrelated to product

3. **Suggestive** - Suggests quality but requires imagination (NETFLIX for streaming)
   - Strong protection
   - Implies something about the product

4. **Descriptive** - Describes the product (BEST BUY for retail)
   - Weak protection
   - Only protectable with acquired distinctiveness (secondary meaning)
   - Requires proof that consumers associate the mark with source

5. **Generic** - Common name for the product (COMPUTER for computers)
   - No protection
   - Cannot be trademarked

**Recommendation:** Aim for fanciful, arbitrary, or suggestive marks for strongest protection.

#### Trademark Search Process

**Before using or filing trademark:**

1. **Preliminary knockout search:**
   - Search USPTO TESS database (free): https://tmsearch.uspto.gov/
   - Search common law uses: Google, social media, domain names
   - Check state registrations
   - Look at competitor names
   - Cost: Free, 1-2 hours

2. **Comprehensive search** (recommended before significant investment):
   - Hire trademark search firm ($300-$1,500)
   - Searches federal, state, common law uses, domain names, social media
   - Opinion letter on likelihood of conflict
   - Identifies potential issues before filing

**What to search for:**
- Identical marks in your class
- Similar marks in your class
- Identical marks in related classes
- Phonetically similar marks (sounds the same)
- Visually similar marks (looks similar)
- Marks with same meaning (translations, synonyms)

#### Trademark Classes

Trademarks are registered by class of goods/services. There are 45 international classes:

**Goods (Classes 1-34):**
- Class 9: Software, electronics
- Class 25: Clothing
- Class 28: Toys and sporting goods
- Class 41: Education and entertainment services

**Services (Classes 35-45):**
- Class 35: Advertising and business services
- Class 42: Computer and scientific services
- Class 44: Medical services

**Important:** You must file in each class where you use or intend to use the mark. Each class has a separate fee.

**Examples:**
- Apple uses trademark in Class 9 (computers) and Class 38 (telecommunications)
- Nike uses trademark in Class 25 (clothing) and Class 28 (sporting goods)

#### Federal vs. State Trademark Registration

**Federal Registration (USPTO):**
- **Pros:**
  - Nationwide protection
  - Constructive notice (presumed knowledge of your rights)
  - Right to use ® symbol
  - Legal presumption of ownership and exclusive right to use
  - Ability to bring lawsuit in federal court
  - Can register with U.S. Customs to stop infringing imports
  - Basis for international registration
- **Cons:**
  - More expensive ($250-$350 per class government fee)
  - Longer process (6-12+ months)
  - Stricter requirements
- **When to use:** Planning to use mark nationwide, want strongest protection

**State Registration:**
- **Pros:**
  - Lower cost ($50-$200 typically)
  - Faster (1-3 months)
  - Protection within state
- **Cons:**
  - Limited to state boundaries
  - No ® symbol
  - Less protection in disputes
  - Junior to federal marks
- **When to use:** Local business only, not planning expansion, limited budget

**Common Law Rights:**
- No registration needed
- Protection only in geographic area of actual use
- Can use ™ symbol
- Much harder to enforce
- No presumption of ownership

**Recommendation:** Federal registration for any business with growth plans or online presence.

#### Trademark Application Process

**Step 1: Determine Basis**
- **Use in Commerce (1a):** Already using mark in interstate commerce
  - Must provide: First use date, first use in commerce date, specimen of use
- **Intent to Use (1b):** Plan to use but haven't started yet
  - Must actually use before registration completes (file Statement of Use later)
  - Extra fee when filing Statement of Use ($100)

**Step 2: Prepare Application**
Required information:
- Applicant name and address
- Mark (word, design, or both)
- Goods/services description (be specific)
- Class(es)
- Specimen (if use-in-commerce)
- Filing basis
- Fee ($250-$350 per class)

**Specimen Requirements:**
- For goods: Photo of product with mark, packaging, labels, tags
- For services: Advertising, website, brochures showing mark used in connection with services
- Must show mark as actually used in commerce (not mock-up)

**Step 3: File Application**
- File online at USPTO.gov (TEAS)
- TEAS Plus: $250/class (more requirements, cheaper)
- TEAS Standard: $350/class (fewer requirements)
- Pay filing fee (non-refundable even if rejected)

**Step 4: USPTO Examination (3-4 months)**
- Examining attorney reviews application
- Issues Office Action if issues found:
  - Likelihood of confusion with existing mark
  - Mark is merely descriptive
  - Specimen inadequate
  - Identification of goods/services unclear
- Response required within 6 months

**Step 5: Publication for Opposition (30 days)**
- If approved, mark published in Official Gazette
- Third parties can oppose if they believe it would harm them
- If no opposition (or opposition fails), proceed to registration

**Step 6: Registration or Statement of Use**
- **Use-in-commerce applications:** Registration issues
- **Intent-to-use applications:** Must file Statement of Use showing actual use before registration issues
  - Deadline: 6 months after Notice of Allowance (can extend up to 3 years)
  - Fee: $100/class

**Total Timeline:** 6-12 months (if no issues), up to 18+ months if Office Actions or extensions

**Total Cost:**
- DIY: $250-$350/class (government fees only)
- With attorney: $1,000-$2,000/class (including attorney fees)

#### Using Trademark Symbols

**™ (Trademark):**
- Use with any unregistered trademark for goods
- Can use from first use, even before filing application
- Puts others on notice of claim
- No legal requirement to use

**℠ (Service Mark):**
- Use with any unregistered trademark for services
- Same as ™ but for services

**® (Registered Trademark):**
- Use ONLY after federal registration issues
- Using ® without registration is illegal (fraud)
- Provides notice of registration and statutory benefits
- Should appear next to mark in prominent location

**Proper Usage:**
- First or most prominent use in text: "BRAND®"
- Superscript or subscript acceptable
- Can note at bottom: "BRAND is a registered trademark of Company, Inc."

#### Maintaining Trademark Registration

**Federal Registration Maintenance:**

- **Years 5-6:** Declaration of Continued Use (Section 8) + Request for Inviolability (Section 15)
  - Deadline: Between 5th and 6th anniversary of registration
  - Fee: $225-$425 per class
  - Must show mark still in use with specimen
  - Section 15 makes mark "incontestable" (stronger rights)

- **Years 9-10:** Combined Declaration and Renewal (Sections 8 & 9)
  - Deadline: Between 9th and 10th anniversary
  - Fee: $300-$500 per class
  - Every 10 years thereafter

- **Continuous Use Requirement:**
  - Must use mark in commerce continuously
  - 3+ years of non-use = presumed abandonment
  - Can lose rights even with valid registration

**Policing Your Trademark:**
- Monitor for infringement (watch for similar marks)
- Send cease and desist letters when appropriate
- Oppose similar trademark applications
- Use it or lose it - maintain continuous use
- Control quality if licensing
- Failure to police can result in:
  - Loss of rights
  - Mark becoming generic (Aspirin, Escalator, Thermos were once trademarks)

#### International Trademark Protection

**U.S. Registration ≠ International Protection**

Options for international protection:

1. **Madrid Protocol:**
   - File one application through USPTO to designate multiple countries
   - Covers 120+ countries
   - Cost-effective for multiple countries
   - Requires U.S. application or registration as basis
   - Fee: varies by country ($100-$400 per country typically)

2. **Direct National Applications:**
   - File separately in each country
   - More expensive but stronger
   - No dependency on U.S. application
   - Required for countries not in Madrid Protocol

3. **European Union Trademark (EUTM):**
   - Single application covers all EU member states
   - Cost-effective for Europe
   - All-or-nothing (refusal in one country can block entire registration)

**Recommendation:** If planning international business, budget for international trademark protection.

**Duration:**
- Utility patents: 20 years from filing date
- Design patents: 15 years from grant date
- Plant patents: 20 years from filing date

**Registration:** Required to obtain any protection

#### Types of Patents

**1. Utility Patents (Most Common)**
- **Protect:** How something works, what it does, how it's made
- **Examples:**
  - New software algorithm
  - Pharmaceutical drug
  - Manufacturing process
  - Mechanical device
  - Chemical composition
  - Biotechnology invention
- **Requirements:**
  - Novel (new)
  - Non-obvious (not obvious to person skilled in the art)
  - Useful (has practical application)
- **Duration:** 20 years from filing date
- **Cost:** $5,000-$15,000+ with attorney
- **Timeline:** 1-3 years

**2. Design Patents**
- **Protect:** Ornamental appearance/design of functional item
- **Examples:**
  - iPhone shape
  - Coca-Cola bottle design
  - Furniture design
  - GUI icons

  - Novel
  - Non-obvious
  - Ornamental (not dictated by function)
- **Duration:** 15 years from grant
- **Cost:** $2,000-$5,000 with attorney
- **Timeline:** 12-18 months
- **Note:** Can have both design and utility patent on same product

**3. Plant Patents**
- **Protect:** New varieties of asexually reproduced plants
- **Examples:** New rose variety, fruit tree
- **Duration:** 20 years from filing
- **Less common** for most businesses

#### Patentability Requirements

**1. Novelty:**
- Invention must be new
- Cannot be:
  - Previously patented
  - Described in printed publication
  - In public use
  - On sale
  - Otherwise publicly known
- **One-year grace period in U.S.** from public disclosure
  - Not true in many other countries (absolute novelty required)
  - Best practice: File before ANY public disclosure

**2. Non-Obviousness:**
- Invention must not be obvious to person skilled in the art
- Even if combining known elements, combination must produce unexpected result
- Most rejections based on obviousness

**3. Usefulness (Utility):**
- Must have practical application
- Must work as described
- Generally easy to satisfy

**4. Proper Subject Matter:**
- **Can be patented:**
  - Machines
  - Processes/methods
  - Manufactures (articles of manufacture)
  - Compositions of matter
  - Improvements to any of the above
  - Software (if tied to specific machine or transformation)
  - Business methods (limited)

- **Cannot be patented:**
  - Laws of nature
  - Natural phenomena
  - Abstract ideas
  - Mathematical formulas (alone)
  - Purely mental processes

#### Patent Search (Prior Art Search)

**Why search before filing:**
- Expensive to file patent application ($8,000-$15,000+)
- Need to know if invention is novel
- Identify similar inventions to claim around
- Assess strength of potential patent

**How to search:**

1. **USPTO Patent Database** (free):
   - PatFT: Issued patents (1976-present full text)
   - AppFT: Published applications
   - Search by keyword, inventor, classification
   - Review images and claims

2. **Google Patents** (free):
   - User-friendly interface
   - Searches USPTO and other patent offices
   - Shows related patents
   - PDF download

3. **Professional search** (recommended):
   - Patent attorney or search firm
   - $1,000-$3,000
   - More thorough (includes foreign patents, non-patent literature)
   - Opinion on patentability

**What to search:**
- Keywords describing invention
- Problem solved
- Similar products
- Competitors
- Classification codes

**Evaluation:**
- Identical invention = not patentable
- Similar inventions = may still be patentable if sufficient differences
- No similar inventions = potentially strong patent (but expand search)

#### Patent Application Process

**Provisional vs. Non-Provisional**

**Provisional Patent Application:**
- **Pros:**
  - Lower cost ($70-$300 government fee, $1,500-$3,000 with attorney)
  - Faster to prepare
  - Establishes filing date
  - Can claim "patent pending"
  - 12 months to file non-provisional
  - Allows testing market before committing to full application
- **Cons:**
  - Never examined (not a real patent)
  - Expires after 12 months if no non-provisional filed
  - Must file non-provisional to get actual patent
  - Time does NOT count toward 20-year term
- **When to use:**
  - Need to establish priority date quickly
  - Still developing invention
  - Want to test market first
  - Need "patent pending" status
  - Want to delay $$$

**Non-Provisional Patent Application:**
- **Pros:**
  - Gets examined
  - Can result in actual patent grant
  - 20-year term starts from filing
- **Cons:**
  - More expensive ($300-$900 government fee, $8,000-$15,000+ with attorney)
  - More formal requirements
  - Longer to prepare
- **When to use:**
  - Ready to pursue full patent
  - No provisional filed
  - Foreign filing not planned (provisional helpful for foreign rights)

**Application Components:**

1. **Specification:**
   - Title
   - Background of invention
   - Summary
   - Brief description of drawings
   - Detailed description (enable others to make and use)
   - Must teach best mode

2. **Claims:**
   - Most important part (defines scope of protection)
   - Independent claims (stand alone)
   - Dependent claims (refer back to independent claims)
   - Broader claims = more protection but easier to invalidate
   - Narrower claims = stronger but less protection

3. **Drawings:**
   - Required if necessary to understand invention
   - Must show every feature in claims
   - Specific USPTO formatting rules
   - Can be informal for provisional

4. **Abstract:**
   - Brief summary (150 words max)

**Filing Process:**

1. **Prepare application** (attorney or DIY)
2. **File with USPTO** online
3. **Pay fees:**
   - Filing fee: $70-$300 (provisional), $300-$900 (non-provisional)
   - Search fee: $0 (provisional), $140-$700 (non-provisional)
   - Examination fee: $0 (provisional), $180-$800 (non-provisional)
   - Entity size matters: Micro (discounts), Small (discounts), Large (full price)

4. **Receive filing date and number**
5. **Publication** (18 months after filing, unless opt-out for domestic-only)
6. **Examination** (1-3 years wait)
7. **Office Actions** (usually multiple rounds)
8. **Allowance or abandonment**
9. **Pay issue fee** ($500-$1,200)
10. **Patent grants**

**Timeline:** Typically 2-3 years from filing to grant (can be faster with prioritized examination)

**Total Cost:**
- DIY: $2,000-$5,000 (government fees, drawings, etc.)
- With attorney: $8,000-$15,000 (often more for complex inventions)

#### Patent Pending Status

**What it means:**
- Patent application filed but not yet granted
- Provides notice to others
- No enforcement rights yet
- Cannot sue for infringement until patent grants

**Can say:**
- "Patent Pending"
- "Patent Applied For"

**Cannot say:**
- "Patented" (false marking, illegal)

**Benefits:**
- Deters competitors
- Establishes filing date
- Shows innovation to customers/investors

**Duration:**
- Lasts until patent grants or application abandons
- No legal protection during pending status (but damages can start from publication)

#### Maintenance Fees (Utility Patents Only)

Unlike trademarks, patents require maintenance fees:

- **Years 3.5-4:** First maintenance fee ($800-$3,600)
- **Years 7.5-8:** Second maintenance fee ($1,800-$7,400)
- **Years 11.5-12:** Third maintenance fee ($3,700-$12,350)

**Failure to pay = patent expires**

Design patents have no maintenance fees.

#### International Patent Protection

**U.S. Patent ≠ International Protection**

Options:

1. **Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT):**
   - File one "international" application
   - Delays decision on which countries (up to 30 months)
   - Search and preliminary examination
   - Must still file nationally in each country eventually
   - Cost: $4,000-$10,000+ for PCT, then $5,000-$15,000+ per country
   - 150+ member countries

2. **Direct National Filing:**
   - File in each country within 12 months of U.S. filing
   - Expensive ($5,000-$15,000 per country)
   - Required for non-PCT countries

**Important:**
- Many countries require absolute novelty (file BEFORE any public disclosure)
- U.S. has 1-year grace period, most countries don't
- Each country has separate costs
- Translation costs can be significant

**Strategy:**
- File U.S. provisional first
- Within 12 months, file PCT or national applications
- Select countries based on market and manufacturing

#### Patent vs. Trade Secret

**When to patent:**
- Invention can be reverse-engineered
- Want to prevent others from using
- Need to disclose to raise funding
- Want to license technology
- 20 years of protection sufficient

**When to use trade secret instead:**
- Cannot reverse-engineer (Coca-Cola formula)
- Want indefinite protection
- Can maintain secrecy
- Patent too difficult or expensive to obtain

**Remember:** Once publicly disclosed, cannot use trade secret protection

---

### 3. Copyrights

**What They Protect:** Original works of authorship fixed in tangible medium

**Duration:**
- Individual: Life + 70 years
- Work for hire: 95 years from publication or 120 years from creation (whichever shorter)

**Registration:** Optional (protection automatic upon creation) but provides significant benefits

#### What Can Be Copyrighted

**Protected Works:**
- **Literary works:** Books, articles, blog posts, computer code, documentation
- **Musical works:** Songs, compositions (sheet music and lyrics)
- **Dramatic works:** Plays, scripts, screenplays
- **Choreographic works:** Dance routines (if notated)
- **Pictorial/graphic/sculptural:** Photos, paintings, graphics, sculptures
- **Motion pictures/audiovisual:** Movies, videos, animations
- **Sound recordings:** Recorded music, podcasts
- **Architectural works:** Building designs
- **Software:** Source code and object code
- **Databases:** If selection/arrangement is creative

**What Cannot Be Copyrighted:**
- **Ideas** (only expression of ideas)
- **Facts** (compilations of facts may be if creative selection)
- **Procedures, processes, systems, methods** (get patent instead)
- **Titles, names, short phrases, slogans** (may be trademarked)
- **Works not fixed in tangible form** (improvisation, unrecorded speech)
- **Government works** (U.S. government publications)
- **Works in public domain**

**Copyright vs. Trademark:**
- Copyright: Protects creative expression
- Trademark: Protects brand identifiers

**Example:**
- Book title: Cannot copyright, but can trademark if it becomes a brand (Harry Potter as brand)
- Book content: Copyright protected

#### Automatic Protection

**Copyright exists immediately upon creation** when:
1. Work is original (minimal creativity required)
2. Fixed in tangible medium (written, recorded, saved)

**No registration required for protection**

**Can use © symbol immediately:**
- Format: © [Year] [Owner Name]
- Example: © 2025 John Doe
- Not required but recommended

**Common law copyright:**
- Exists automatically
- Enforceable in court
- BUT registration provides additional benefits

#### Copyright Registration Benefits

**Why register?**

1. **Prerequisite to lawsuit:**
   - For U.S. works, must register before suing
   - Can register after infringement discovered but lose benefits

2. **Statutory damages:**
   - Without registration: Only actual damages (hard to prove, often small)
   - With registration: $750-$30,000 per work (up to $150,000 if willful)
   - Don't need to prove actual damages

3. **Attorney's fees:**
   - Without registration: Pay your own attorney (expensive)
   - With registration: Can recover attorney's fees if you win

4. **Public record:**
   - Establishes ownership
   - Constructive notice
   - Discoverability

5. **Customs protection:**
   - Can register with U.S. Customs to stop infringing imports

**Timing matters:**
- **Register within 3 months of publication:** Get all benefits
- **Register within 5 years:** Presumption of validity
- **Register after infringement starts:** No statutory damages or attorney's fees for prior infringement

**Recommendation:** Register important works, especially those you'll monetize or license.

#### Copyright Registration Process

**Step 1: Determine Type of Work**
- Literary work
- Visual arts
- Performing arts
- Sound recording
- Motion picture
- Group registration (multiple works)

**Step 2: Prepare Application**
- Online at copyright.gov/eco
- Required information:
  - Title of work
  - Author name
  - Year of creation
  - Year of publication (if published)
  - Copyright claimant
  - Type of work

**Step 3: Pay Fee**
- Online: $45-$65 (most common)
- Paper: $125 (not recommended)
- Special handling: $800 (expedited)

**Step 4: Submit Deposit Copy**
- Usually electronic copy of work
- Requirements vary by type:
  - Literary: Full text
  - Visual: Image file
  - Software: First 25 and last 25 pages of source code
  - Sound recording: Audio file

**Step 5: Wait for Registration**
- Online: 3-6 months typically
- Paper: 8-10 months
- Special handling: 5-7 business days (extra fee)

**Total Cost:** $45-$65 for DIY

#### Work Made for Hire

**Two scenarios:**

1. **Employee creating work within scope of employment:**
   - Employer owns copyright automatically
   - No agreement needed (but recommended)
   - Applies to full-time, part-time, salaried employees

2. **Independent contractor:**
   - Contractor owns copyright by default
   - Can be work-for-hire ONLY if:
     a) Written agreement states "work made for hire" AND
     b) Work falls into one of 9 categories (contribution to collective work, part of motion picture, translation, supplementary work, compilation, instructional text, test, answer material, atlas)
   - Better: Have contractor assign copyright in writing

**Assignment vs. License:**
- **Assignment:** Transfer of ownership (permanent)
- **License:** Permission to use (can be limited by time, geography, purpose)

**Best Practice:**
- Written agreement with all contractors/freelancers
- Either work-for-hire clause (if applicable) OR
- Assignment of rights clause
- Before work begins

**Sample Clause:**
```
All work product created by Contractor under this Agreement shall be the sole property of Company as "work made for hire" under U.S. copyright law. To the extent any work product does not qualify as work made for hire, Contractor hereby assigns to Company all right, title, and interest in such work product.
```

#### Software Copyright

**Source Code:**
- Protected as literary work
- Copyright exists upon creation
- Register with Copyright Office

**Object Code:**
- Also protected
- Include in deposit if registering

**What copyright protects:**
- Literal code (copying code is infringement)
- Non-literal elements (if substantially similar)
- Structure, sequence, organization (SSO) - limited protection

**What copyright does NOT protect:**
- Ideas or algorithms (may be patentable)
- Functions or methods (may be patentable)
- User interfaces (mixed - some elements)
- APIs (recent cases say no)

**Open Source:**
- Still copyright protected (owner is licensor)
- License grants permissions
- Different licenses (MIT, GPL, Apache, etc.)
- Copyleft (GPL) requires derivative works to be open source
- Permissive (MIT, Apache) allows proprietary derivatives

**Best Practices:**
- Include copyright notice in source files
- Choose and apply open source license if applicable
- Register copyright for important software
- Use license agreements with developers
- Protect trade secrets (confidential algorithms)

#### Fair Use

**Affirmative defense to infringement**

**Four factors (no bright-line rule):**

1. **Purpose and character of use:**
   - Transformative use favored (commentary, criticism, parody)
   - Commercial use disfavored (but not fatal)
   - Educational use favored (but not automatic fair use)

2. **Nature of copyrighted work:**
   - Factual works: More fair use (phone books)
   - Creative works: Less fair use (novels, movies)
   - Published works: More fair use
   - Unpublished works: Less fair use

3. **Amount and substantiality:**
   - Small amounts favored
   - But "heart of the work" even if small percentage can be infringement
   - No specific percentage safe (30 seconds of song NOT automatically fair use)

4. **Effect on market:**
   - Most important factor
   - Would use substitute for original or licensed use?
   - Harm to potential market (not just current market)

**All four factors weighed together**

**Examples of Fair Use:**
- Quoting short excerpt in review
- Parody (transformative)
- News reporting (factual)
- Scholarship and research (limited excerpts)
- Search engine thumbnail images

**NOT Fair Use (usually):**
- Using entire song in video (even with credit)
- Using image found on Google in commercial work
- Copying software to avoid buying licenses
- Creating fan fiction that competes with original

**Myths:**
- Giving credit = fair use ❌ (helps but not sufficient)
- Using < 30 seconds = fair use ❌ (no bright line)
- Non-profit use = fair use ❌ (factor but not determinative)
- Couldn't find owner = fair use ❌ (orphan works still protected)

**Best Practice:** If not clearly fair use, get license or don't use.

#### DMCA and Online Infringement

**Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA)**

**Notice and Takedown:**
- Copyright owner finds infringement online
- Sends DMCA notice to hosting platform
- Platform must expeditiously remove or face liability
- Alleged infringer can file counter-notice
- If counter-notice, content can be restored after 10-14 days (unless owner files lawsuit)

**Safe Harbor for Platforms:**
- Online platforms (YouTube, Facebook, ISPs) not liable for user infringement if:

### 4. Trade Secrets

**What They Protect:** Confidential business information providing competitive advantage

**Duration:** Indefinite (as long as maintained as secret)

**Registration:** None (protection through secrecy measures)

#### What Qualifies as Trade Secret

**Requirements:**
1. **Information** (formula, pattern, compilation, program, device, method, technique, process)
2. **Has independent economic value** from not being generally known
3. **Subject to reasonable efforts to maintain secrecy**

**Examples:**
- **Formulas:** Coca-Cola formula, KFC recipe
- **Processes:** Manufacturing processes, algorithms
- **Customer lists:** Names, contacts, preferences (if not public)
- **Source code:** Proprietary software code
- **Business methods:** Pricing strategies, marketing plans
- **Financial information:** Cost structures, profit margins
- **Research data:** R&D results, test data

**What is NOT a trade secret:**
- Public information
- Generally known information in industry
- Easily discoverable information
- Information disclosed without protection
- Information not subject to secrecy measures

#### Maintaining Trade Secrets

**Reasonable measures required:**

1. **Access Controls:**
   - Limit who can access information
   - Need-to-know basis only
   - Physical security (locked rooms, safes)
   - Digital security (passwords, encryption, access logs)

2. **Confidentiality Agreements:**
   - NDAs with employees
   - NDAs with contractors and vendors
   - NDAs with business partners
   - Confidentiality clauses in employment agreements

3. **Training:**
   - Employee training on protecting confidential information

   - Digital watermarks if appropriate
   - Confidential headers/footers

5. **Exit Procedures:**
   - Return of confidential materials
   - Reminder of ongoing confidentiality obligations
   - Exit interviews

**What you DON'T need:**
- Bank vault-level security
- Perfect security
- Only "reasonable" measures given circumstances

#### NDAs for Trade Secret Protection

**Key provisions:**

1. **Definition of Confidential Information:**
   - Specific enough to be meaningful
   - Broad enough to cover information
   - Include examples

2. **Exclusions:**
   - Already known
   - Independently developed
   - Publicly available (not through breach)
   - Rightfully obtained from third party

3. **Obligations:**
   - Maintain in confidence
   - Use only for permitted purpose
   - Protect with reasonable care

4. **Duration:**
   - Disclosure period: How long can information be shared?
   - Confidentiality period: How long must recipient keep it confidential?
     - Consider: How long will information have value?
     - Typical: 2-5 years
     - Can be indefinite for true trade secrets

5. **Return/Destruction:**
   - Upon request or termination
   - Certification of destruction

6. **Remedies:**
   - Injunctive relief (money damages inadequate)
   - Attorney's fees
   - Actual damages

#### Trade Secret vs. Patent

**Choose trade secret when:**
- Information cannot be reverse-engineered (Coke formula)
- Want indefinite protection (>20 years)
- Can maintain secrecy reliably
- Don't need to disclose to raise funding/commercialize
- Patent prosecution too expensive

**Choose patent when:**
- Product can be reverse-engineered
- Need to disclose to manufacturers/partners
- Want right to exclude others
- Need to show IP for funding
- 20 years sufficient
- Want to license technology

**Cannot do both:**
- Patent requires public disclosure
- Public disclosure destroys trade secret

**Can use both for different aspects:**
- Patent some aspects
- Keep other aspects as trade secret
- Example: Patent product design, keep manufacturing process secret

#### Defend the Economic Espionage Act (DTSA)

**Federal trade secret protection** (passed 2016)

**Provides:**
- Federal civil action for trade secret misappropriation
- Covers trade secrets related to products/services used in interstate/foreign commerce
- Allows ex parte seizure in extraordinary circumstances
- Damages: Actual damages and unjust enrichment OR reasonable royalty
- Attorney's fees for bad faith
- Can sue in federal court (previously only state law claims)

**Whistleblower Immunity:**
- Employees/contractors have immunity for disclosing trade secrets to government or attorney in connection with reporting suspected legal violations
- Required: Notice of immunity in NDAs/employment agreements

**Notice requirement template:**
```
NOTICE OF IMMUNITY UNDER THE DEFEND TRADE SECRETS ACT:

An individual may not be held criminally or civilly liable under any federal or state trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret that:
(A) is made (i) in confidence to a federal, state, or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney; and (ii) solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or
(B) is made in a complaint or other document that is filed under seal in a lawsuit or other proceeding.

An individual who files a lawsuit for retaliation by an employer for reporting a suspected violation of law may disclose the employer's trade secrets to the attorney and use the trade secret information in the court proceeding if the individual:
(A) files any document containing the trade secret under seal; and
(B) does not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order.
```

Include this in all NDAs and employment agreements.
